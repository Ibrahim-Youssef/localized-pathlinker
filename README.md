Integrating Protein Localization with  Automated Signaling Pathway Reconstruction

For a signaling pathway of interest, this method identifies paths that connect pathway-specific receptors to pathway-specific transcriptional regulators within a weighted protein-protein interactome.

## Installation Instructions
* Localized PathLinker was tested on Python 2.7.9 and requires the following python package(s):
  - NetworkX 1.9.1.
  
* The proteins localization information is needed. Download the "Integrated protein-protein interaction dataset" for the "H. sapiens" from the <a href="http://comppi.linkgroup.hu/downloads">ComPPI databasse</a>.
